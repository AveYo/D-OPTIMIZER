HOW TO INSTALL:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are on Windows, using the batch file is the recommended method!

Try to close Steam before running it

Updated!


For manual install, unpack and copy the zip file content to your steamapps folder where Dota 2 is installed 
then add Dota 2 Launch Option: -LV

Probably works on Linux and Mac too...

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Important notice to Valve (most definitely rhetorical):
  - Instead of killing legit scripts that bring mostly ergonomic features, why not hunt down actual, reactive cheats from the Ensage family instead - it's been years! Just follow the money...
  - You've killed autoexec.cfg months ago, and still haven't delivered on GUI alternatives for many features that users have developed and got used to over the years.
  - But why do that in the first place?! How hard is to parse a +/- alias and just block multiple distinct abilities+items? Armlet toggling? it should have been nerfed years ago on the backend.
  - Feel free to kill this, but for the love of our Lord, don't VAC users running an unmodified copy of this "sensitive" mod

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Important notice to Modders:
  - While this is not strictly VAC-safe, it should be as long as 
  there are no multiple [distinct] abilities/items per [single] hotkey.
  - Invoke, duel, blink-call, bear-recall and any other ability and/or item combo scripts will always be illegal!
  - Please refrain from doing any of that, you will only lead to this being killed too, like autoexec.cfg was.
  - D-OPTIMIZER does not condone cheating in any way so don't even ask about it!
