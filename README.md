## WHAT IS THIS
It's an addon - like a custom game, it uses it's own vpk, that contains just one panorama keys cfg, one dota keys cfg, one help-page xml and one help-page css - this help-page is not in the game, but it can be called from the panorama keys cfg.
To make it really easy to switch on/off and also to be compatible with other languages, it uses the dota_lv as it's base folder. Adjusted panorama language settings for the various GUI changes are dropped there too. Adding/removing -lv launch option enables/disables it. 

## HOW TO INSTALL:
If you are on Windows, the batch file is recommended for hassle-free installation. Plus it's 100-times smaller.

Doing it manually is not too difficult either, only two steps required:
- [ ] add Dota 2 Launch Option: -LV
- [ ] unpack and copy the zip file content to your steamapps folder where Dota 2 is installed

**\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta\game\dota_lv\** should now contain _pak01_dir.vpk_ and the _panorama_ subfolder with the language files. 

_This probably works on Linux and Mac too..._

Important notice to Valve (most definitely rhetorical):
  - Instead of killing legit scripts that bring mostly ergonomic features, why not hunt down actual, reactive cheats from the Ensage family instead - it's been years! Just follow the money...
  - You've killed autoexec.cfg months ago, and still haven't delivered on GUI alternatives for many features that users have developed and got used to over the years.
  - But why do that in the first place?! How hard is to parse a +/- alias and just block multiple distinct abilities+items? Armlet toggling? it should have been nerfed years ago on the backend.
  - Feel free to kill this, but for the love of our Lord, don't VAC users running an unmodified copy of this "sensitive" mod

Important notice to Modders:
  - While this is not strictly VAC-safe, it should be as long as 
  there are no multiple [distinct] abilities/items per [single] hotkey.
  - Invoke, duel, blink-call, bear-recall and any other ability and/or item combo scripts will always be illegal!
  - Please refrain from doing any of that, you will only lead to this being killed too, like autoexec.cfg was.
  - D-OPTIMIZER does not condone cheating in any way so don't even ask about it!
