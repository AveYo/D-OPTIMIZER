#### Benchmark.cfg (no external tools needed, uses built-in Source 2 reporting)

[As .zip including replay file](https://github.com/AveYo/D-OPTIMIZER/releases/download/3.0/Dota_2_benchmark.zip)  
This probably needs refactoring, use the [light version](https://github.com/AveYo/D-OPTIMIZER/releases/tag/3.0l) in the mean time
